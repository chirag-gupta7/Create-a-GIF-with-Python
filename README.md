|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `image_folder` | str | Required | Path to folder containing images |
| `output_path` | str | Required | Where to save your GIF |
| `duration` | float | 0.5 | Seconds between frames |

## 🎯 Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Progress Showcase
Perfect for showing before/after transformations or project progress:
```python
create_gif(
    'project_progress/',
    'development_journey.gif',
    duration=1.0  # Slower for detailed viewing
)
```

### Example 2: Quick Animation
Great for social media or presentations:
```python
create_gif(
    'animation_frames/',
    'social_media_ready.gif',
    duration=0.1,    # Super fast
    optimize=True    # Smaller file for web
)
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting & Tips

### Common Issues & Solutions

**🚫 "No images found in folder"**
- Make sure your images have common extensions (.jpg, .png, .gif, .bmp)
- Check that the folder path is correct

**📏 "Images are different sizes"**
- The script automatically resizes images to match the first image
- For best results, use images with similar dimensions

**💾 "GIF file is too large"**
- Set `optimize=True`
- Reduce `quality` parameter
- Use fewer images or smaller dimensions

### Pro Tips 💡
- **Naming matters**: Images are processed in alphabetical order
- **Quality balance**: Quality 85 offers the best size/quality ratio
- **Frame rate sweet spot**: 0.1-0.5 seconds works great for most animations
